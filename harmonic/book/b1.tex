Chapter 1 is organized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fourier coefficients and Series
    \item Criteria for pointwise convergence
    \item Convergence in norm
    \item summability methods
    \item The fourier transform of $L^1$ functions
    \item Schwartz class and tempered distributions
    \item Fourier transform on $L^p$, for $1<p\leq 2$
    \item Convergence and summability of Fourier Integrals
    \item Further results
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Some Notations}
The Lebesgue measure in $\R^n$ will be denoted using $dx$, and on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$ will be $d\sigma$.

Let $a=(a_1, ..., a_n)\in\mathbb{N}^n$ be a multiindex, and $f:\R^n\to\C$, then
\begin{equation*}
    D^af=\frac{\partial^{|a|}f}{\partial_{x_1}^{a_1}...\partial_{x_n}^{a_n}}
\end{equation*}
where $|a|=a_1+...+a_n$.


\begin{theorem}[Minkowski's integral inequality.]
    Given $(X,\mu), (Y,\nu)$ as $\sigma$-finite measure spaces, we have the following inequality
    \begin{equation*}
        \left(\int_X\left|\int_Yf(x,y)d\nu(y) \right|^pd\mu(x) \right)^{1/p}\leq\int_Y \left(\int_X|f(x,y)^pd\mu(x) \right)^{1/p}d\nu(y)
    \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

Taking $\nu$ to be the counting measure over a two point set $S={1,2}$ gives the usual Minkowski inequality
\begin{equation*}
    \|f_1+f_2\|_{L^p}\leq\|f_!\|_{L^p}+\|f_2\|_{L^p}
\end{equation*}

We will use $\mathcal{D}$ to denote the space of test functions, i.e. $C_c^\infty$, and $\mathcal{S}$ to denote the space of Schwartz functions. Recall the dual of $\mathcal{D}$, denoted as $\mathcal{D}'$ is the space of distrubitons, and $\mathcal{S}'$ is the space of temperate distributions.

\begin{definition}[Convolution of distribution]
    Let $T\in\mathcal{D}'$, and $f\in\mathcal{D}$, then we define
    \begin{equation*}
        T\ast f(x)=\langle T, \tau_x\tilde{f}\rangle
    \end{equation*}
    where $\tilde{f}(y)=f(-y)$, and $\tau_xf(y)=f(x+y)$. Hence it can be read as $T\ast f(x)=\langle T, f(x-y)\rangle$
\end{definition}
\begin{comment}
The theory of distribution will come in when we need meaningful differentiation but derivatives don't exist in the classical sense.
\end{comment}
\begin{comment}
    Tradionally, functions are thought of as sending points to points, but distributions are linear functions that act on a test function and send it to a point. In other words, distributions send functions to points using $\phi\mapsto\int u\phi dx$.
\end{comment}

\subsection{1.1 Review of definitions}
We now do some math.
If $f$ is a trigonometric series, of the form
\begin{equation*}
    f(x)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty c_ne^{2\pi inx}
\end{equation*}
Then we find $c_n$ for any fixed $n$ by multiplying $f(x)$ by $e^{-2\pi inx}$, and integrate. Namely, we have
\begin{equation*}
    \int_0^1\sum_nc_ne^{2\pi inx}\cdot e^{-2\pi inx}=\int_0^1 c_n=c_n
\end{equation*}

We denote the additive group of $\R/\mathbb{Z}$ by $\T$, which gives $[0,1)$, and naturally identifies with $S^1$. Hence, saying a function $f$ defined on $\T$ is the same as saying $f$ is defined on $\R$ with period 1.

\begin{definition}[Fourier coefficients]
    Fix $f\in L^1(\T)$, we associate the sequence $\{\hat{f}(n)\}$ of $f$ defined by
    \begin{equation*}
        \hat{f}(k)=\int_0^1f(x)e^{-2\pi inx}dx
    \end{equation*}
    And its Fourier series defined as
    \begin{equation*}
        \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(n)e^{2\pi inx}
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}


\subsection{1.2 Critera for pointwise convergence}
Define the $N$-th partial sum in the natural way. For pointwise convergence, the first result is due to Dirichlet, which states that if $f$ is bounded and has a finite number of maxima and minima, and pointwise continuous, then the limit of $S_N(f)(x)$ exists and is equal to $\frac{1}{2}(f(x+)+f(x-))$. As we saw in class, one can express $S_N(f)(x)$ as a convolution
\begin{equation*}
    S_N(f)(x)=D_N(f)\ast f(x)
\end{equation*}
where $D_N(t)=\sum_{n=-N}^Ne^{2\pi int}$. And for any $\delta>0$, we have
\begin{equation*}
    \int_0^1D_n(t)dt=1, |D_N(t)|\leq\frac{1}{|\sin(\pi t)}, \delta\leq |t|\leq\frac{1}{2}
\end{equation*}

To prove Dini's and Jordan's criterion, we first do some prep work.
\begin{definition}[bounded variation]
    The total variation of $f:I\to\C$ is defined by
    \begin{equation*}
        V(f,I)=\sup_N\sup_{x_0\leq...\leq x_N}\sum_{j=1}^N|f(x_j)-f(x_{j-1})|
    \end{equation*}
    And $f$ is of bounded variation if $V(f,I)<\infty$.
\end{definition}

Now we introduce the Riemann Localization principle, which states if two functions agree on a small neighborhood of a fixed point $x$, then their Fourier coefficients also agree at $x$. If we recall how Fourier coefficients are computed.
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{f}(n)=\int_0^1f(x)e^{2\pi inx}
\end{equation*} 
If we change $f$ in other places, not in the neighborhood of $x$, it seems like the integral would change as well. But we will show now, this is not the case.

\begin{theorem}[Riemann Localization Principle]
    If $f=0$ in $(x-\delta, x+\delta)$, then we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \lim_{N\to\infty}S_N(f)(x)=0
    \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    This is purely computational and it is done by writing out $S_N(f)(x)$ as a convolution and realizing $S_N(f)(x)$ is a sum of the Fourier coefficnets of two integral functions, hence its Fourier coefficients decay to 0, making $S_N(f)$ decay to 0 as well.
\end{proof}

One ingredient in the proof was the Riemann Lebesgue lemma, which states that the Fourier coefficent of integrable functions decays to 0. This 
\begin{lemma}[Riemann-Lebesgue]
    If $f\in L^1(\T)$, then we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \lim_{|n|\to\infty}\hat{f}(n)=0
    \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    One could either approximate $f$ with continuous functions or simple functions, either would work. If suffices to show $\hat{f}(n)\to 0$ for $f$ continuous, and it's pure arithmatic manipulation, and for $f$ simple functions, we can use integration by parts. Then we would recover that the Fourier transform decays as $|n|\to\infty$.
\end{proof}

We now state two local pointwise results, using the theorems we proved above.

\begin{theorem}[Dini's Criterion]
    Let $f$ be such that for a fixed $x$,
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_{|t|\leq\delta}\left|\frac{f(x+t)-f(x)}{t} \right|dt<\infty
    \end{equation*}
    Then we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \lim S_N(f)(x)=f(x)
    \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We would want to show that 
    \begin{equation*}
        S_N(f)-f(x)\to 0
    \end{equation*}
    This means
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{|t|\leq1/2}(f(x-t)-f(x))\frac{\sin((2N+1)\pi t)}{\sin(\pi t)}&=\int_{|t|\leq\delta}(f(x-t)-f(x))\frac{\sin((2N+1)\pi t)}{\sin(\pi t)}\\
        &+\int_{\delta\leq t\leq1/2}(f(x-t)-f(x))\frac{\sin((2N+1)\pi t)}{\sin(\pi t)}
    \end{align*}
    Hence if we write $\sin((2N+1)\pi t)$ as $(e^{(2N+1)\pi t}-e^{-(2N+1)\pi t})/2$ again, we can write the above two integrals as the Fourier coefficient of two integrable functions, and by the Riemann Lebesgue lemma, we conclude as $N\to\infty$, $S_N(f)(x)\to f(x)$.
\end{proof}
\qed

\begin{remark}
    In the proof of Dini's theorem and Riemann Localization principle, we both first write out the partial sum $S_N(f)$ as the convolution again $\frac{\sin((2N+1)\pi t)}{\sin(\pi t)}$, and to finish up, we transformed this back to a Fourier coefficient by expanding out $\sin((2N+1)\pi t)$, and used Riemann Lebesgue lemma.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Jordan's Criterion]
    If $f$ is of bounded variation in a neighborhood of $x$, then we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \lim_{N\to\infty}S_N(f)(x)=\frac{1}{2}[f(x+)+f(x-)]
    \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    If $f$ is of bounded varation in $(x-\delta, x+\delta)$, then we have $f=f^+-f^-$, where both $f^+, f^-$ are monotonic. Hence we can assume $f$ is monotonic in a nbhd of $x$. (Justification: if we can prove $S_N(f^+)=\frac{1}{2}(f^+(x+)+f^+(x-))$, and similarly for $f^-$, then we can add up and recover $f$.)

    Assuming $f$ is monotonic, we have
    \begin{equation*}
        S_N(f)(x)=\int_{|t|\leq1/2}f(x-t)D_N(t)dt=\int_0^{1/2}\left(f(x-t)+f(x+t) \right)D_N(t)dt
    \end{equation*}
    And thus assuming $x=0$, it suffices to prove
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_0^{1/2}f(t)D_N(t)dt\to\frac{1}{2}f(0^+)
    \end{equation*}
    Moving terms, and noting $D_n(t)=\frac{\sin((2N+1)\pi t)}{\sin(\pi t)}$ is an even function, we get $\frac{1}{2}f(0^+)=f(0^+)\int_0^{1/2}D_N(t)$. Hence it suffices to show the following integral tends to 0.
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_0^{1/2}(f(t)-f(0^+))D_N(t)dt=\int_0^\delta(f(t)-f(0^+))D_N(t)dt+\int_\delta^{1/2}(f(t)-f(0^+))D_N(t)dt
    \end{equation*}
    By the same arguemnt, the second integral tends to 0. To treat the first integral, we apply the second mean value theorem for integrals, which states for continuous $\varphi$, and monotonic $h$, there exists $c$, $a<c<b$, 
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_a^b h\varphi=h(a+)\int\varphi+h(b-)\int\varphi
    \end{equation*}
    This deals with the bad $t$ around 0, and we are left with good, integrable terms,
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_0^\delta(f(t)-f(0^+))D_N(t)dt=\int_c^\delta(f(t)-f(0^+))D_N(t)dt
    \end{equation*}
    Again, we have an integrable function, writing it as a Fourier coefficient, we have $\int_0^{1/2}f(t)D_N(t)\to\frac{1}{2}f(0^+)$.
\end{proof}
\qed
