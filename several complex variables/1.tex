We will start now.


\chapter{Lecture 1}
We start with the goal. Let $M$ be a compact complex manifold. And we consider $(L, h)\to M$, positive hermitian line bundle.
\begin{remark}
    The positive is used in studying subharmoniciity
\end{remark}

Holomorphic sections of powers of $L$, note there is no holomorphic functions on the compact manifolds except for constants, hence we consider Holomorphic sections of powers of $L$, denoted by $H^0(M, L^{\bigotimes k})$

we note that $H^0(M, L^{\bigotimes k})$ is a hilbert space, and 
${S_0^k,... , S_{d_k}^k}$ is a basis of $H^0$.
Bergman of $f^n$, we have 
\begin{equation}
    B_k(z)=\sum_{j=0}^{d_k}|S_j^k(z)|_h^2
\end{equation}

Main result, we have
\begin{equation*}
    B_k(z)=z_0k^n+a_1k^{n-1}+...
\end{equation*}
If we define a function from the manifold to the projective space,
$\phi_k=M\to\mathbb{C}P^{d_k}$, we will introduce Kodaida's embedding, if $k>>1$, then $\phi_k$ is an embedding.
